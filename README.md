# FinBot - Finance Management Service üí∞

---

## üìù Project Description / Abstract

**FinBot** is a full-stack AI-powered platform that helps users manage and track **any kind of data** using **natural chat, voice commands, and manual operations**‚Äîin both **Bengali** and **English**. It allows users to interact with data tables through simple conversations instead of using complex forms or dashboards, while also providing traditional manual data management capabilities.

For example, users can type, say, or manually input:
_"Add a new task: Finish assignment by Monday"_
_"Show all completed tasks from last week"_
_"Delete the expense added yesterday"_
_"ajk ami sylet e 100tk khoroch korechi"_

FinBot uses **Claude AI** with **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to understand these commands and provide direct database access to the language model. The system features **voice chat capabilities** for hands-free operation and comprehensive **database sharing** functionality for collaborative financial management.

Key innovations include:

- **Model Context Protocol Integration**: Direct LLM access to database operations
- **Voice Chat Interface**: Real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities
- **Collaborative Database Sharing**: Share tables and data with friends and family
- **Hybrid Manual/AI Operations**: Traditional table management alongside conversational AI

The system is built with:

- **Next.js** for the frontend interface with voice integration
- **Django REST Framework** for the backend with MCP server
- **Claude AI** with Model Context Protocol for enhanced database interactions
- **WebRTC/Browser APIs** for voice input and output
- **Real-time streaming** for enhanced user experience

All data is stored in **dynamic tables** with full collaborative features, which can represent anything‚Äîtasks, finances, inventories, events, and more. Users can seamlessly switch between voice commands, text chat, and manual table operations.

## By combining conversational AI, voice interfaces, and collaborative features with flexible API-driven data storage, FinBot reduces manual work by **over 80%** and offers the most intuitive, multilingual, and accessible way to manage structured data.

- **Data Integrity**: CASCADE delete operations maintain referential integrity

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Architecture Overview

### Dynamic Table Creation Concept

FinBot uses a revolutionary **3-tier dynamic schema** that allows users to create any type of table structure on-the-fly:

#### **Tier 1: Table Metadata** (`DynamicTableData`)

- Stores basic table information (name, owner, description)
- Tracks creation and modification timestamps
- Links tables to specific users for data isolation
- Maintains pending operation counters

#### **Tier 2: Dynamic Headers** (`JsonTable`)

- Stores column headers as flexible JSON arrays
- Allows runtime schema modifications
- Supports any number of columns with any names
- One schema per table with unique constraints

#### **Tier 3: Flexible Data Storage** (`JsonTableRow`)

- Stores actual row data as JSON objects
- Each row matches the header structure from Tier 2
- Supports any data type (strings, numbers, dates, etc.)
- Maintains creation timestamps for audit trails

### How Dynamic Tables Work

**Example: Creating an Expense Table**

1. **User Creates Table**: "Monthly Expenses"

   ```
   Table Metadata: {
     name: "Monthly Expenses",
     description: "Track monthly spending",
     owner: user_123
   }
   ```

2. **System Defines Headers**: Dynamic column structure

   ```
   Headers: ["Date", "Category", "Amount", "Description", "Payment Method"]
   ```

3. **User Adds Data**: Flexible row insertion

   ```
   Row 1: {
     "Date": "2024-06-14",
     "Category": "Groceries",
     "Amount": "85.50",
     "Description": "Weekly shopping",
     "Payment Method": "Credit Card"
   }

   Row 2: {
     "Date": "2024-06-15",
     "Category": "Gas",
     "Amount": "45.00",
     "Description": "Fill up tank",
     "Payment Method": "Debit Card"
   }
   ```

### Key Architecture Benefits

- **üîÑ Runtime Schema Changes**: Add/remove columns without database migrations
- **üìä Unlimited Data Types**: Store any JSON-compatible data structure
- **üë• Multi-User Isolation**: Each user's tables are completely separate
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Optimized JSON indexing for fast queries
- **üîç Complex Queries**: Search across any field using JSON operations
- **üõ°Ô∏è Data Integrity**: Automatic relationship management and cleanup

### Table Relationship Flow

```
User Account
    ‚Üì (owns multiple)
Table Definitions
    ‚Üì (each has one)
Column Headers
    ‚Üì (stores multiple)
Data Rows
```

This design allows FinBot to support any type of data management - from simple expense tracking to complex project management - all through the same flexible architecture.
